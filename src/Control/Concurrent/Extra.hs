-- | Extra functions for "Control.Concurrent".
--
--   This module includes three new types of 'MVar', namely 'Lock' (no associated value),
--   'Var' (never empty) and 'Barrier' (filled at most once). See
--   <https://neilmitchell.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/flavours-of-mvar_04.html this blog post>
--   for examples and justification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- LOCK

-- | Like an 'MVar', but has no value.
--   Used to guarantee single-threaded access, typically to some system resource.
--   As an example:
--
-- @
-- lock <- 'newLock'
-- let output = 'withLock' lock . putStrLn
-- forkIO $ do ...; output \"hello\"
-- forkIO $ do ...; output \"world\"
-- @
--
--   Here we are creating a lock to ensure that when writing output our messages
--   do not get interleaved. This use of 'MVar' never blocks on a put. It is permissible,
--   but rare, that a withLock contains a withLock inside it - but if so,
--   watch out for deadlocks.
newtype Lock = Lock (MVar ())

-- | Create a new 'Lock'.
newLock :: IO Lock
newLock = Lock <$> newMVar ()

-- | Perform some operation while holding 'Lock'. Will prevent all other
--   operations from using the 'Lock' while the action is ongoing.
withLock :: Lock -> IO a -> IO a
withLock (Lock x) = withMVar x . const

-- | Like 'withLock' but will never block. If the operation cannot be executed
--   immediately it will return 'Nothing'.
withLockTry :: Lock -> IO a -> IO (Maybe a)
withLockTry (Lock m) act =
    bracket
        (tryTakeMVar m)
        (\v -> when (isJust v) $ putMVar m ())
        (\v -> if isJust v then fmap Just act else pure Nothing)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- VAR

-- | Like an 'MVar', but must always be full.
--   Used to operate on a mutable variable in a thread-safe way.
--   As an example:
--
-- @
-- hits <- 'newVar' 0
-- forkIO $ do ...; 'modifyVar_' hits (+1); ...
-- i <- 'readVar' hits
-- print (\"HITS\",i)
-- @
--
--   Here we have a variable which we modify atomically, so modifications are
--   not interleaved. This use of 'MVar' never blocks on a put. No modifyVar
--   operation should ever block, and they should always complete in a reasonable
--   timeframe. A 'Var' should not be used to protect some external resource, only
--   the variable contained within. Information from a 'readVar' should not be subsequently
--   inserted back into the 'Var'.
newtype Var a = Var (MVar a)

-- | Create a new 'Var' with a value.
newVar :: a -> IO (Var a)
newVar = fmap Var . newMVar

-- | Read the current value of the 'Var'.
readVar :: Var a -> IO a
readVar (Var x) = readMVar x

-- | Write a value to become the new value of 'Var'.
writeVar :: Var a -> a -> IO ()
writeVar v x = modifyVar_ v $ const $ pure x

-- | Modify a 'Var' producing a new value and a return result.
modifyVar :: Var a -> (a -> IO (a, b)) -> IO b
modifyVar (Var x) = modifyMVar x

-- | Modify a 'Var', a restricted version of 'modifyVar'.
modifyVar_ :: Var a -> (a -> IO a) -> IO ()
modifyVar_ (Var x) = modifyMVar_ x

-- | Perform some operation using the value in the 'Var',
--   a restricted version of 'modifyVar'.
withVar :: Var a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
withVar (Var x) = withMVar x

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- BARRIER

-- | Starts out empty, then is filled exactly once. As an example:
--
-- @
-- bar <- 'newBarrier'
-- forkIO $ do ...; val <- ...; 'signalBarrier' bar val
-- print =<< 'waitBarrier' bar
-- @
--
--   Here we create a barrier which will contain some computed value.
--   A thread is forked to fill the barrier, while the main thread waits
--   for it to complete. A barrier has similarities to a future or promise
--   from other languages, has been known as an IVar in other Haskell work,
--   and in some ways is like a manually managed thunk.
newtype Barrier a = Barrier (MVar a)

-- | Create a new 'Barrier'.
newBarrier :: IO (Barrier a)
newBarrier = Barrier <$> newEmptyMVar

-- | Write a value into the Barrier, releasing anyone at 'waitBarrier'.
--   Any subsequent attempts to signal the 'Barrier' will throw an exception.
signalBarrier :: Partial => Barrier a -> a -> IO ()
signalBarrier (Barrier var) v = do
    b <- tryPutMVar var v
    unless b $ errorIO "Control.Concurrent.Extra.signalBarrier, attempt to signal a barrier that has already been signaled"

-- | Wait until a barrier has been signaled with 'signalBarrier'.
waitBarrier :: Barrier a -> IO a
waitBarrier (Barrier var) = readMVar var

-- | A version of 'waitBarrier' that never blocks, returning 'Nothing'
--   if the barrier has not yet been signaled.
waitBarrierMaybe :: Barrier a -> IO (Maybe a)
waitBarrierMaybe (Barrier bar) = tryReadMVar bar
