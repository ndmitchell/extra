-- | A version of 'dropWhileEnd' but with different strictness properties.
--   The function 'dropWhileEnd' can be used on an infinite list and tests the property
--   on each character. In contrast, 'dropWhileEnd'' is strict in the spine of the list
--   but only tests the trailing suffix.
--   This version usually outperforms 'dropWhileEnd' if the list is short or the test is expensive.
--   Note the tests below cover both the prime and non-prime variants.
--
-- > dropWhileEnd  isSpace "ab cde  " == "ab cde"
-- > dropWhileEnd' isSpace "ab cde  " == "ab cde"
-- > last (dropWhileEnd  even [undefined,3]) == undefined
-- > last (dropWhileEnd' even [undefined,3]) == 3
-- > head (dropWhileEnd  even (3:undefined)) == 3
-- > head (dropWhileEnd' even (3:undefined)) == undefined
